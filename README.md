# RonaPHP
RonaPHP is a PHP framework that takes an MVC approach to application building and utilizes a modular design for separating the various parts of an application. RonaPHP handles configuration, route building, resource control, API integration, heavy-lifting procedure building, templating, and more. RonaPHP is designed for PHP 7.

The version 1 series is undergoing rapid development and new versions are added frequently. As such, documentation is currently unavailable and changes should be expected. As the framework becomes more stable, documentation will be created and more backwards compatibility will be added to changes. Contact Ryan Whitman for questions.
